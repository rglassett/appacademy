# Tic-tac-toe AI

We're going to write a computer AI that can't be beaten at
TicTacToe. Go to the [TicTacToeAI Repo][ttt-repo] and **download the
ZIP**. This has our TTT solution code, plus some stub classes for you
to fill out. Check that you can run the specs:

    bundle exec rspec spec/01_tic_tac_toe_node_spec.rb
    bundle exec rspec spec/02_super_computer_player_spec.rb

Of course, they should be failing right now. Call your TA over if you
have problems.
